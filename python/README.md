# About data in this folder

internet_words.json is the data that has been chosen to be used for this project. It is a list of all English words.

words2.json is a version of words.json that excludes words that did not appear in a list of words retrieved from my Linux OS.

Another way of putting it is I took words.json, found all the words that were in words.json, but were not in a list of words from my Linux OS, then subtracted those words from the words.json. This list is words2.json.
